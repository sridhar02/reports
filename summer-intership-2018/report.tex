DAY 2-6

We were acknowledged with BOP Accumulator


\underline{BOP Accumulator}

An accumulator is a unit used to hydraulically operate Rams BOP,HCR and some hydraulic equipment. There are several high pressure cylinders that store nitrogen or hydraulic fluid or water under pressure for hydraulic activated systems. The primary purpose of this unit is to supply hydraulic power to the BOP stack in order to close or open BOP stack for both normal and emergency situation. Stored hydraulic fluid in the accumulator provides hydraulic power to close BOP in well control operation so that the kick is minimized.The BOP accumulator was charged at 3000 psi with nitrogen. The minimum pressure required to close the BOP was 1200 psi.The ratings of both Annular Preventer and Shear and Blind Ram were 5000 psi.The BOP at the RIG is pressure tested after every 21 days or whenever the rig is set up at new site and BOP is installed whichever is the least. Pressure test is done using water if there will be leakage the water will leak from that points.The BOP is also function tested whether it is being open or closed when given command to open or close.


\noindent Then we were briefed about the solid control equipments.Solid Control Equipments The solid control equipments consist of:

\begin{itemize}

\item Shale Shaker
\item Desander
\item Desilter
\item Degasser

\end{itemize}
