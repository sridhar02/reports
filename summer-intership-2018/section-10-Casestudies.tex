\noindent Well logging was being done and logging crew was taking the open
hole caliper log.

\textbf{Caliper Log:} A caliper log is a well logging tool that provides a
continuous measurement of the size and the shape of borehole along
its depth and is commonly used in hydrocarbon exploration and
development wells during drilling to keep a check on the hole size.Fig 10.2 shows the image of the caliper log.

\vspace{1em}

The caliper tool measures the variation in the borehole diameter as it
is withdrawn from the bottom of the hole, using two or more
articulated arms that push against the bore hole wall. Each arm is
typically connected to a potentiometer which causes the resistance to
change as the diameter of the hole changes.

A caliper log is a well logging tool that provides a continuous measurement of the size and 
shape of a borehole along its depth[1] and is commonly used in hydrocarbon exploration when 
drilling wells. The measurements that are recorded can be an important indicator of cave ins or 
shale swelling in the borehole, which can affect the results of other well logs. Known challenges with 
caliper logging include borehole spiralling. The position of the drill bit may precess as it drills, 
leading to spiraling shapes in the wellbore wall, as if the hole had been drilled by a screw. 
If the arms of the caliper log follow the grooves of the spiral, it will report too high an average diameter.
Moving in and out of the grooves, the caliper will give erratic or periodically varying readings.
